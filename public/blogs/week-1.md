**Author:** Md Hafizur Rahman | **Date:** October 22 - October 27, 2024

Welcome to our very first Hexalayer weekly blog! This week was all about **laying the groundwork** for our company’s journey. From setting up our brand identity to organizing internal communication, we tackled every task with enthusiasm and a vision for the future.

## 🏢 **Establishing Our Identity**  
The first step toward building Hexalayer was creating a strong and recognizable **brand identity**:  
- **Company Name:** After thoughtful deliberation, we chose "Hexalayer" to reflect our **versatility** and **multi-dimensional expertise**.

To ensure smooth internal and external communication, we established a robust infrastructure:  
- **Internal Communication Tools:**  
  - **Slack** for seamless team collaboration and instant messaging.  
  - **Gmail** for professional email communication.  

- **Social Media Presence:**  
  We set up official accounts on the following platforms to connect with our audience and clients:

## 📋 **Choosing Project Management Tools**  
Managing tasks and tracking progress efficiently is vital for success. After careful evaluation, we selected:

  - **Why YouTrack?**  
    - Customizable workflows.  
    - Seamless issue tracking and task prioritization.  
    - A user-friendly interface that keeps everyone on the same page.
