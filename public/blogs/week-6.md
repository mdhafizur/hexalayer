# Week 6: Design Meets Development  

**Author:** Huzefa Jadliwala | **Date:** November 25 - December 1, 2024  

This week marked a pivotal transition from conceptual planning to active execution. We focused on refining designs, finalizing our tech stack, and organizing development tasks into actionable sprints for **HexaShield**, our AI-powered security assessment tool. The synergy between technical and creative efforts became the foundation for efficient progress, setting the tone for the coming weeks of development.

## 💡 **Making Technical and Creative Decisions**  

With a strong vision and clear objectives, we delved deeper into defining the technical and creative frameworks for HexaShield. Each decision was aimed at ensuring scalability, user-friendliness, and robust performance.  

### Key Accomplishments:  

1. **Tech Stack Selection:**  
   - **Frontend:**  
     We chose **React** as our frontend library, paired with **Material UI** and **TypeScript** for a modern, responsive, and scalable user interface. This combination enables us to maintain consistency in design and ensures type safety for faster debugging and development.  
   - **Backend:**  
     Opted for **Flask**, a lightweight and flexible framework, to handle server-side operations with **MongoDB** as the database for its powerful querying capabilities and seamless scaling.  
   - **Cloud Storage:**  
     Decided to use **MongoDB Cloud** for reliable and secure cloud data storage, ensuring availability and fault tolerance.  
   - **State Management:**  
     Selected **Redux** for predictable state management, ensuring smooth interaction between components and reducing the risk of data inconsistencies.  
   - **Deployment:**  
     Chose **DigitalOcean** for deployment, offering robust and scalable solutions with simplified management of our infrastructure.  

2. **Frontend and Backend Architecture:**  
   - Established a **scalable and modular architecture** for the frontend, defining clear folder structures for components, assets, utilities, and Redux stores.  
   - Designed backend architecture to handle multiple microservices, ensuring **seamless API communication** using RESTful services.  
   - Focused on building a robust middleware layer to handle authentication, authorization, and data validation.  

3. **Figma Design Creation:**  
   - Refined initial wireframe designs to create a polished and user-friendly interface.  
   - Developed **high-fidelity UI/UX mockups** for all major components, including the dashboard, assessment workflows, and reporting modules.  
   - Paid special attention to accessibility and responsiveness, ensuring HexaShield offers a seamless experience across devices.  
   - Incorporated feedback from multiple stakeholders to refine designs iteratively, making sure every detail aligns with user needs and HexaShield’s vision.  

4. **Task Breakdown and Sprint Planning:**  
   - Created a comprehensive list of tasks for both frontend and backend development, breaking them down into granular subtasks.  
   - Aligned development tasks with Agile methodology, organizing them into **two-week sprints** to ensure measurable and continuous progress.  
   - Defined **priority milestones**, including core features like user authentication, dynamic dashboard updates, and real-time reporting.  
   - Leveraged tools like **Youtrack** to track progress and monitor dependencies across tasks.  

5. **Team Collaboration:**  
   - Conducted brainstorming sessions with cross-functional teams to finalize technical and design choices.  
   - Hosted architecture review meetings to ensure that everyone was aligned on project goals and technical requirements.  
   - Established a feedback loop to address challenges early and adapt plans dynamically.
